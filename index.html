            <h3>Why should I trust this website?</h3>
            <p>It's up to your instinct whether you want to trust this website or not.
                However, it is hosted on github pages, which only supports static websites.
                Therefore, this website is entirely serverless, and the source code is available in the footer.
                Also, even if we stored your password, we would have no clue who you are!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pass_faq_div">
            <h3>How do you estimate how long a computer would take to crack my password?</h3>
            <p>Via brute-force, which is trying out all possible combinations of characters possible until the right password is found.
                Lists of common passwords and dictionaries are used for brute-forcing, which is why we detect patterns and common passwords for you.</p>

        <div class="pass_faq_div">
            <h3>How do we check leaked passwords?</h3>
            <p>We use lists of common passwords from <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists" target="_blank">SecLists</a>
                which is a trustworthy and reputable source, with a lot of contributions.</p>

        <div class="pass_faq_div">
            <h3>Why is password security important?</h3>
            <p>Not having secure passwords can have a great impact on you.
                Hackers will be able to log in to your account and steal your data, including your name, address, phone number and bank details.
                They can use this information to try and steal money for personal gain, directly from you, or steal your identity.
                This is a major compromise on your privacy. Moreover, depending on the service, hackers gaining access to your account could be much worse.
                If they log in to your IP security cameras, they may record footage of you which could be used for blackmail.</p>

            <h3>How can I ensure my passwords are secure?</h3>
            <p>Check your password using our tool, as well as:
                <br> • Ideally at least 16 characters or more.
                <br> • A combination of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
                <br> • Include numbers and characters, such as $, %, #, @.
                <br> • Make it random - LMN4uj25_#jr is a better password than GoldenFish8#.
                <br> • No patterns or consecutive characters, such as AAA or 123.
                <br> • Ideally use different passwords on different services.
